   Discover a project where mathematics meets natural selection.
   We explore Bézier surfaces, the elegant curves shaped by control points and Bernstein polynomials, and breathe new life into them using genetic algorithms inspired by evolutionary biology.
   In our application, each Bézier surface is a digital organism. By encoding its control points as a genome, we apply crossover and mutation operations to generate entirely new surfaces—offspring that inherit features from their “parent” surfaces and evolve over time.
   This hybrid approach bridges geometric design and computational intelligence, opening up creative possibilities for surface modeling, generative art, and procedural design.
   
   Are you ready to see what happens when Bézier meets Darwin?
