   UniPast: the Mangiagalli project is a cooperative gaming experience where players must work together to conquer increasingly challenging platform levels. Each level is meticulously crafted and designed to encourage teamwork among players. Each character will have unique powers or abilities that must be strategically combined to reach the end of the level.
   As players journey through the game, different zones will get unlocked progressively on the map of “Città Studi”. Within these zones, players will encounter different platform levels and a strategic save point represented by an Inn. The Inn serves as a hub where players can immerse themselves in the vibrant history of “Città Studi” and learn about the events that occurred in the past. Alternatively, the players can choose to relax in the Inn by playing some of the available minigames. 
   At its core, UniPast: The Mangiagalli Project aims to make players collaborate and know each other.
   Obstacles are designed to require the coordination of character abilities, emphasizing the necessity of teamwork to overcome each level’s challenges. With each triumph, players not only progress through the game but also deepen their bonds with fellow adventurers, forging unforgettable memories in the process.
