  Sometimes people just want to kill someone and get away with it. However, not everyone is a crime genius... and that's where you come in!
  As a member of Murder Mystery Incorporated, your goal is to orchestrate Pulitzer-worthy assassinations and have the guilt fall on someone else, leaving your client free of any suspicions.
  <br><br>
  <strong>Features:</strong><br>
  • Prepare the environment<br>
  • Plan your actions on a timeline<br>
  • Refer to the guests' profiles to predict their behavior<br>
  • Choose your scapegoat and make sure all hints point to them<br>
  • Then, on the night of the crime, sit back and watch your genius unfold.
  <br><br>
  At the core of the game lies this "trial and error" philosophy, aiming to entertain the player as they search for the best way to be a killer without being seen.
